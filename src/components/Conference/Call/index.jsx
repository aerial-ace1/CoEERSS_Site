      The ICACNI core committee invites proposals from institutes for co-organizing the 10th
      conference in 2020. The preferred conference date is during 2nd or 3rd week of March 2020.
      Other nearby dates can be discussed. The committee expects the co-organizing institution to
      bear some responsibilities of managing the conference, and hence a group of active organizers
      is most welcome.
